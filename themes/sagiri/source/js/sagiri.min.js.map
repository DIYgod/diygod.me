This is all done automatically and internally.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * Every definition will be added to a \"com.greensock\" global object (typically window, but if a window.GreenSockGlobals object is found,\n\t\t\t * it will go there as of v1.7). For example, TweenLite will be found at window.com.greensock.TweenLite and since it's a global class that should be available anywhere,\n\t\t\t * it is ALSO referenced at window.TweenLite. However some classes aren't considered global, like the base com.greensock.core.Animation class, so\n\t\t\t * those will only be at the package like window.com.greensock.core.Animation. Again, if you define a GreenSockGlobals object on the window, everything\n\t\t\t * gets tucked neatly inside there instead of on the window directly. This allows you to do advanced things like load multiple versions of GreenSock\n\t\t\t * files and put them into distinct objects (imagine a banner ad uses a newer version but the main site uses an older one). In that case, you could\n\t\t\t * sandbox the banner one like:\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * <script>\n\t\t\t *     var gs = window.GreenSockGlobals = {}; //the newer version we're about to load could now be referenced in a \"gs\" object, like gs.TweenLite.to(...).

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n

For example, boxShadow has values like \"10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)\" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like \"s\" or \"xn1\" or \"xn2\") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like \"boxShadow_xn1\" and \"boxShadow_xn2\") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.\n\t\t\t * This method returns an object that has the following properties:\n\t\t\t *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.

These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of \"extra\" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where \"s\" indicates string and \"n\" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be \"5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)\". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.\n\t\t\t * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):\n\t\t\t *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.\n\t\t\t *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)\n\t\t\t *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.\n\t\t\t *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.\n\t\t\t *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.\n\t\t\t * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.\n\t\t\t * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be \"width\".\n\t\t\t * @param {number} s Starting numeric value\n\t\t\t * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.\n\t\t\t * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:\"1px solid red\"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.\n\t\t\t * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a \"clip:rect(...)\" tween in which case \"p\" might be xs1 but \"n\" is still \"clip\"\n\t\t\t * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order.
